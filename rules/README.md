The chef that best embodies this spirit of a lasagna goes first.


## Lasagna Recipe


A Rainbow Lasagna is complete if all of the following conditions are met:



1. Starts with a Pan
2. After the pan, ingredients alternate between Noodle and Cheese
    1. First ingredient can be either Noodle or Cheese
3. Colors must follow rainbow order
    2. Ascending (ROYGBV) or Descending (VBGYOR) the spectrum are both valid, but a lasagna can’t alternate up and down the spectrum
    3. Color(s) may be skipped (e.g. Red Pan -> Green Noodle)
    4. Color(s) may be repeated (e.g. Red Pan -> Red Noodle -> Orange Cheese)
4. At least 3 unique colors in the lasagna, including the pan
5. At least 3 ingredients, not including the pan


## Gameplay

Chefs take turns doing one of the following **_actions_**:



1. Give a hint
2. Discard a card
3. Play an ingredient


### Action: Give a hint

If there are available hint tokens, the chef expends a hint token to give a hint to another chef.

The chef chooses to give either a color hint or ingredient hint.

The chef must **_indicate all the cards that apply to the hint_** in their teammate's hand!

Avoid discussing the content of a chef’s hand outside of giving a hint.


#### Color Hint

The chef chooses a color and indicates to a teammate which of their hand cards match the chosen color by pointing at the cards.


#### Ingredient Hint

The chef chooses an ingredient type (Pan, Noodle, or Cheese) and indicates to a teammate which of their hand cards match the chosen color by pointing at the cards.


### Action: Discard a Card

The chef discards a card face up in the discard pile to restore a hint token.

The chef then draws a new card to their hand.

If there are no expended hint tokens, then the chef may not choose to discard a card.


### Action: Play an ingredient

The chef plays a card on an existing or new lasagna by placing the ingredient face down.

Flip the card and determine if it follows the recipe.

If it correctly follows the recipe, the ingredient remains in the Lasagna.

If it does not follow the recipe and you have an available mistake token, the new ingredient is moved to the discard pile. If all the mistake tokens have been expended, the whole Lasagna is moved to the discard pile and the game is over.

The chef draws a new card at the end of the turn.


## End of Game

The game ends either when you create 6 Rainbow Lasagnas or add an ingredient that does not follow the recipe after expending all of the mistake tokens.

Take inventory of how many complete Rainbow Lasagnas were created and let the chefs know the outcome of their hard work.
